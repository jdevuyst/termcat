# Termcat

Termcat is a markup language optimized for scientific and technical writing. It compiles to HTML and MathML.

Termcat takes inspiration from LaTeX and Markdown. From Markdown it copies the user-friendly syntax for titles, lists, links, emphasis, and so on. Termcat aims to be more powerful, however. Like LaTeX, Termcat is fully programmable and it also comes with special syntax for typographic features that are difficult to unlock using plain Markdown or HTML.

The [Termcat tutorial](http://jdevuyst.github.io/termcat/doc/termcat-intro.html) provides a general overview of Termcat. The tutorial is also available as a [live demo](http://jdevuyst.github.io/termcat/doc/termcat-demo.html) that runs in your web browser.

Termcat is implemented in Clojure(Script). For more technical details behind the implementation, please consult [my blog](https://jdevuyst.blogspot.com/search/label/Termcat).
