- Item 1
- Item 2
- Bullet items can consist of multiple paragraphs.Simply indent subsequent lines with two extra spaces.- Bullet lists can also be nested
- Once more the trick is to indent the nested lists with two extra spaces.
)</div>This renders as follows:- Item 1
- Item 2
- Bullet items can consist of multiple paragraphs.Simply indent subsequent lines with two extra spaces.- Bullet lists can also be nested
- Once more the trick is to indent the nested lists with two extra spaces.By default, blocks of text that are indented with two spaces are considered blockquotes.The syntax ![alt text](filename.png) includes an image in the document.![Termcat](hello.png)Upright single quotes &apos; render as right quotes ’ (or apostrophes) and backticks ` render as left quotes ‘<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> Termcat automatically inserts extra horizontal whitespace after periods, question marks, exclamation marks, and colons, but o.c. not after acronyms.
Long dashes can be included using double (--/–) or triple (—) hyphens.There’s special syntax for diactritics:
- r%^ole TO rôle
- zo%&quot;even TO zoëven
- n%&apos;ee TO née
- tr%`es TO trèsUsers of pīnyīn can also use the notation %1e, %2e, %3e, %4e for ē, é, ě, and è.It’s possible to change the space between characters:
l%-2pt%ess is m%+0.4ex%ore TO l<span style='margin-left: -2pt'></span>ess is m<span style='margin-left: 0.4ex'></span>ore
Similarly, spaces of variable width can be created using<span style='display: inline-block; width: 1em'> </span>the<span style='display: inline-block; width: 1em'> </span>syntax<span style='display: inline-block; width: 1em'> </span>%_1em<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> Like in LaTeX, tildes can be used for non-breaking spaces<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>:</span> 100~kg TO 100~kg.Two subsequent percent symbols indicate the start of a comment<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> The comment continues until a newline character is encountered<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> 
When % is used in other contexts then it inserts a zero-width space<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> This space will not make it into the output HTML document<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> This is useful when you want to trigger syntactic sugar that only works after or before whitespace<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> For example, type a%**b**%c for a**b**c.To indicate that a symbol is not syntactic sugar, use a backslash \ to escape it.## The Structure of a Termcat DocumentTermcat documents are trees<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> The nodes of these trees—‘blocks’ in Termcat parlance—are delimited by parentheses (), brackets [], braces {}, indentation, or bullet marks<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> One important consequence of this is that parentheses, brackets, and braces must at all times be balanced (unless they’re escaped by backslashes).For many purposes it doesn’t matter how a block is delimited<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> For instance, a numbered list can be created using the notation:
:numbered-list<br>- item 1<br>- item 2
or
:numbered-list(item 1)[item 2]
and it will render as :numbered-list(item 1)[item 2]
&quot;- &quot;-<br>&quot;- ~-~
and Termcat will interpret every minus sign surrounded by whitespace on both sides as a binary infix operator.Predictably, for prefix operators you can type sin~ x or x ~!. This renders as sin~ x or x ~!.When one tilde is used on either side of an operator, Termcat will use the default MathML spacing for that operator<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> Use two tildes to use a ‘thick math space’ spacing and three tildes to use a ‘very very thick math space’.It may sometimes be necessary to type (~ and ~) to indicate that parentheses (or brackets or braces) should be interpreted as mathematical ‘fences’<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> Type &lt;~ and ~&gt; to insert chevrons.Using some of the above knowledge we can use the following code
<div style="white-space: pre-wrap">.lit(

(a^b_c)|d TO (a^b_c)|dTo coerce something to be text, prefix it with a &quot;double &quot;upright &quot;quotes &quot;character &quot;.## Programming(More on this in a future update.)## StatusThis document was compiled using Termcat ([source](https://github.com/jdevuyst/termcat/blob/master/doc/termcat-intro.tc))<span class='wide_punctuation_mark'>.</span> That said, Termcat is still very much a work in progress and is not ready for general use yet.The goal is to have a beta version ready by Christmas 2013.</body></html>
