It compiles to HTML and MathML. To generate PDFs, [Prince](http://www.princexml.com) can be used.Termcat takes inspiration from LaTeX and Markdown. From Markdown it copies the user-friendly syntax for titles, lists, links, emphasis, and so on. Termcat aims to be more powerful, however. Like LaTeX, Termcat is fully programmable and it also comes with special syntax for typographic features that are difficult to unlock using plain Markdown or HTML.## The BasicsThe syntax for titles is the same as in Markdown.# This is a document title## This is a section title### This is a subsection titleSo are the syntax for *emphasis* (*emphasis*), _underline_ (_underline_), and [links](http://example.com) ([links](http://example.com)). Caveat: To emphasize or underline more than one word, it's necessary to enclose the text fragment in a block. Parentheses can be used for this purpose: **(This is strong text)** renders as **(This is strong text)**.Bullet lists can be created by starting a line with a hyphen followed by a space.Consider the following code:<div style="white-space: pre-wrap">.lit(
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Bullet items can consist of multiple paragraphs.Simply indent subsequent lines with two extra spaces.- Bullet lists can also be nested
- Once more the trick is to indent the nested lists with two extra spaces.
)</div>This renders as follows:- Item 1
- Item 2
- Bullet items can consist of multiple paragraphs.Simply indent subsequent lines with two extra spaces.- Bullet lists can also be nested
- Once more the trick is to indent the nested lists with two extra spaces.By default, blocks of text that are indented with two spaces are considered blockquotes.The syntax ![alt text](filename.png) includes an image in the document.![Termcat](hello.png)Upright single quotes ' render as right quotes ' (or apostrophes) and backticks ` render as left quotes `. Termcat automatically inserts extra horizontal whitespace after periods, question marks, exclamation marks, and colons, but o.c. not after acronyms.
Long dashes can be included using double (--/--) or triple (---) hyphens.There's special syntax for diactritics:
- r%^ole TO rôle
- zo%"even TO zoëven
- n%'ee TO née
- tr%`es TO trèsUsers of pīnyīn can also use the notation %1e, %2e, %3e, %4e for ē, é, ě, and è.It's possible to change the space between characters:
l%-2pt%ess is m%+0.4ex%ore TO l%-2pt%ess is m%+0.4ex%ore
Similarly, spaces of variable width can be created using%_1em%the%_1em%syntax%_1em%_1em. Like in LaTeX, tildes can be used for non-breaking spaces: 100~kg TO 100~kg.A percent symbol % followed by a space indicates a comment. A newline signals the end of the comment. 
When % is used in other contexts then it inserts a zero-width space. This space will not make it into the output HTML document. This is useful when you want to trigger syntactic sugar that only works after or before whitespace. For example, type a%**b**%c for a**b**%c.To indicate that a symbol is not syntactic sugar, use a backslash \ to escape it.## The Structure of a Termcat DocumentTermcat documents are trees. The nodes of these trees---`blocks' in Termcat parlance---are delimited by parentheses (), brackets [], braces {}, indentation, or bullet marks. One important consequence of this is that parentheses, brackets, and braces must at all times be balanced (unless they're escaped by backslashes).For many purposes it doesn't matter how a block is delimited. For instance, a numbered list can be created using the notation:
:numbered-list<br>- item 1<br>- item 2
or
:numbered-list(item 1)[item 2]
and it will render as :numbered-list(item 1)[item 2]## MathTermcat has a novel syntax for mathematics. Rather than having delimiters that indicate the start and end of a mathematical expression, Termcat expects to be told what (i) the identifiers, and what (ii) the operators, functions, and predicates are in an expression.At least it expects to be told these things for *some* of the expressions that you type. Termcat can be programmed to recognize common operators and identifiers, and it can also draw inferences.To mark something as a mathematical identifier, prefix it with an asterisk *: *a TO *a. This marks one character. However, when Termcat encounters the expression *abc then it will infer that *b and *c are also identifiers. The result is *abc. To turn a word into an identifier, type *(myvar). This renders as *(myvar)---as in LaTeX, multi-character indentifiers are not italicized. Mathematical identifiers can also be typeset in a caligraphic font by using + instead of *. Thus, +M becomes +M.!bind
- -
- ~-~To use the binary minus operator, type x ~-~ y. This yields x - y.Sounds like a chore? No problem. Simply include the following code at the top of your document:
!bind<br>"- "-<br>"- ~-~
and Termcat will interpret every minus sign surrounded by whitespace on both sides as a binary infix operator.Predictably, for prefix operators you can type sin~ x or x ~!. This renders as sin~ x or x ~!.When one tilde is used on either side of an operator, Termcat will use the default MathML spacing for that operator. Use two tildes to use a `thick math space' spacing and three tildes to use a `very very thick math space'.It may sometimes be necessary to type (~ and ~) to indicate that parentheses (or brackets or braces) should be interpreted as mathematical `fences'. Type <~ and ~> to insert chevrons.Using some of the above knowledge we can use the following code
<div style="white-space: pre-wrap">.lit(

(a^b_c)|d TO (a^b_c)|dTo coerce something to be text, prefix it with a "double "upright "quotes "character ".## Programming(More on this in a future update.)## StatusThis document was compiled using Termcat ([source](https://github.com/jdevuyst/termcat/blob/master/doc/termcat-intro.tc)). That said, Termcat is still very much a work in progress and is not ready for general use yet.The goal is to have a beta version ready by Christmas 2013.</body></html>
